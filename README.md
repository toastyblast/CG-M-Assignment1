# CG-M-AssignmentOne
Code made by Yoran Kerbusch for Edge Hill University course CIS2160 Computer Graphics &amp; Modelling 2018-2019

This code was made for assignments given at Edge Hill University for second-year class CIS2160 Computer Graphics &amp; Moddeling, during 2018-2019.
This coursework included weekly assignments that had to be solved, resulting in a portfolio of code at the end. This was during the first 5 weeks of the course, needing to be turned in at the end of week 5.

The final grade I received for this portfolio of code I made for the assignment is 97.0%, and it was originally completed by me at 7-3-2019 (7th of April, 2019).
